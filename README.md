# SmartWing

The project consists in developing the code of a smart Wing.  

## Flight path :

* acceleration
* rotation
* ascent
* put in landing
* stabilisation
* put in position
* circular flight around coordinates of take-off
* put in position
* descent
* approach/transition
* rounding
* touch down

## State of the Art :

* Dubins :
The shortest curve that connects two points in the two-dimensional Euclidean plane (i.e. x-y plane) with a constraint on the curvature of the path and with prescribed initial and terminal tangents to the path, and an assumption that the vehicle traveling the path can only travel forward. the shortest path will be made by joining circular arcs of maximum curvature and straight lines.

* A* :
Used in pathfinding and graph traversal, which is the process of finding a path between multiple points, called “nodes”. It aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.).
